# pgtools
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/henvic/pgtools?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/henvic/pgtools) [![Build Status](https://github.com/henvic/pgtools/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/henvic/pgtools/actions?query=workflow%3ATests)

pgtools contains features you can rely upon to use PostgreSQL more effectively with [Go](https://golang.org/).
Originally developed at [HATCH Studio](https://hatchstudio.co/) / [Stitch](https://www.stitch3d.com/) for making working with [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/) easier.

Please see the [official documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/henvic/pgtools) or source code for more details.

## Features
### pgtools.Wildcard
Use the Wildcard function to generate expressions for SELECT queries.

Given a table `user`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user {
	username text PRIMARY KEY,
	fullname text NOT NULL,
	email text NOT NULL,
	id text NOT NULL,
	Theme jsonb NOT NULL,
}
```

You might want to create a struct to map it like the following for use with [scany](https://github.com/georgysavva/scany).

```go
type User struct {
	Username string
	FullName string
	Email    string
	Alias    string    `db:"id"`
	Theme    Theme     `db:"theme,json"`
	LastSeen time.Time `db:"-"`
}

type Theme struct {
	PrimaryColor       string
	SecondaryColor     string
	TextColor          string
	TextUppercase      bool
	FontFamilyHeadings string
	FontFamilyBody     string
	FontFamilyDefault  string
}
```

The db struct tag follows the same pattern of other SQL libraries, besides scany.

* A field without a db tag is mapped to its equivalent form in `snake_case` instead of `CamelCase`.
* Fields with `db:"-"` are ignored and no mapping is done for them.
* A field with `db:"name"` maps that field to the name SQL column.
* A field with `db:",json"` or `db:"something,json"` maps to a [JSON datatype](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html) column named _something_.

Therefore, you can use:

```go
sql := "SELECT " + pgtools.Wildcard(User{}) + " WHERE id = $1"
```

instead of

```go
sql := "SELECT username,full_name,email,theme WHERE id = $1"
```

This works better than using `SELECT *` for the following reasons:

* Performance: you only query data that your struct can map.
* Correctness: no mismatch.
* If you add a new field in a struct, you don't need to change your queries.
* scany fails when reading unmapped columns with `SELECT *`, but this solves it.
* If you delete a field, you don't need to change your queries.

#### Limitations
Using `pgtools.Wildcard()` on a JOIN is tricky, and not generally recommended â€“ at least for now.

To see why, take the following example:

```go
sql := `SELECT ` + postgres.Wildcard(Entity{}) + `
	FROM entity
	LEFT JOIN
sister_entity on sister_entity.entity_id = entity.id`
```

This will be roughly translated to:

```sql
SELECT id, name, ...
```

Which is not guaranteed to be correct due to ambiguity.
What we want is to have the following instead:

```sql
SELECT table.field1, table.field2...
```

In this case, we want to write everything manually so that PostgreSQL doesn't try to fetch each field in each joined table, as this might lead to conflicts, extra data, bugs, or eventually an error.

For now, it's better to avoid using `pgtools.Wildcard()` for JOINs altogether, even when it seems to work fine.

### pgtools/sqltest package
You can use `sqltest.Migration` to write integration tests using PostgreSQL more effectively.

Check the [example package](sqltest/example) for usage.

```go
ctx := context.Background()
	migration := sqltest.New(t, sqltest.Options{
		Force: force,
		Files:  os.DirFS("testdata/migrations"),
	})
	conn := migration.Setup(ctx, "")
```
The path indicates where your SQL migration files created for use with [tern](https://github.com/jackc/tern) live.

Example of a tern migration file `003_posts.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
	id text PRIMARY KEY,
	name text NOT NULL,
	message text NOT NULL,
	created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
	modified_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

---- create above / drop below ----
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS posts;
```

To effectively work with tests that use PostgreSQL, you'll want to run your tests with a command like:

```sh
INTEGRATION_TESTDB=true go test -v -race -count 1 ./...
```

* `-race` to pro-actively avoid race conditions
* `-count 1` to disable test caching
* Use an environment variable to opt-in Postgres-related tests (see below how)

Multiple packages might have test functions with the same name, which might result in clashes if you're executing go test with list mode (example: `go test ./...`).
Using `t.Parallel()` doesn't have an effect in this case, and you have two choices:

* Set the field `Options.TemporaryDatabasePrefix` to a unique value.
* Limit execution to one test at a time for multiple packages with `-p 1`.

If you use environment variables to connect to the database with tools like psql or tern, you're already good to go once you create a database for testing starting with the prefix `test`.

We use GitHub Actions for running your integration tests with Postgres in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment.
You can find our workflow in [.github/workflows/integration.yml](.github/workflows/integration.yml).

# Opting-in for tests using environment variable
You can define the following function:

```go
func checkPostgres(t *testing.TB) {
	if os.Getenv("INTEGRATION_TESTDB") != "true" {
		t.Skip("Skipping tests that require database connection")
	}
}
```

Which you can call as the first argument of your tests:

```go
func TestNow(t *testing.T) {
	checkPostgres(t)
	// Continue test here.
	t.Parallel()

	ctx := context.Background()
	migration := sqltest.New(t, sqltest.Options{
		// ...
	}
	// ...
}
```

If all tests on a given package requires database, you can also use:

```go
func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	if os.Getenv("INTEGRATION_TESTDB") != "true" {
		log.Printf("Skipping tests that require database connection")
		return
	}
	os.Exit(m.Run())
}
```

Even if your tests typically require database, it's recommended to use such checks to provide a better developer experience to anyone when they don't need to run the database tests.

## Acknowledgements
HATCH Studio uses the following Postgres-related software, and this work is in direct relation to them.

* [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) is a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go.
* [tern](https://github.com/jackc/tern) is a standalone migration tool for PostgreSQL and part of the pgx toolkit.
* [scany](https://github.com/georgysavva/scany) is a library for scanning data from a database into Go structs.
